### About Satori

Thank you to Satoshi Nakamoto and all the Bitcoin developers for Bitcoin. Thank you Bruce Fenton, Tron Black, BlondFrogs, Hans, Zeroth and all the Ravencoin/Evrmore developers for Ravencoin/Evrmore.

Satori (SAT) is a blockchain DeFi (decentralized finance) platform with built-in asset and DeFi primitives. Satori is based on the Bitcoin (BTC) UTXO model, is mined publicly and transparently using Proof-of-Work, is free and open source and is open for use and development in any jurisdiction. Satori is built as a code and UTXO fork of Ravencoin (RVN) and grew out of DeFi discussions and research within the Ravencoin community. Satori employs full replay protection and forks Satori’s coins but not assets. It takes additional measures to protect Ravencoin because it seeks not to replace Ravencoin, but to co-exist with a different purpose. Ravencoin extended the Bitcoin UTXO model with asset primitives thereby eliminating errors commonly caused by implementing assets as "colored coins.” Satori similarly extends the Bitcoin UTXO model with DeFi primitives thereby eliminating errors commonly caused by implementing DeFi in general-purpose smart contracts – implementing DeFi functionality using powerful and general-purpose smart contracts is not the correct solution. In addition to DeFi primitives, Satori includes features that improve transaction speed, flexibility, zero-confirmation, minimal transaction fees, scaling and complex covenant financial derivatives. Satori also includes code development financing and uses the Ethash algo to keep hardware requirements affordable and competitive  

### Mining

#### Satori Mainnet uses KAWPOW GPU Proof-of-Work mining

#### Compatible with standard KAWPOW miners (same as Ravencoin).
